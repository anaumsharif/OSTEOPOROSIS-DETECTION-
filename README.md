# OSTEOPOROSIS-DETECTION-
This ML model was created as a problem statement given by a company during an Internship
This model detects 'OSTEOPOROSIS'. 
OSTEOPOROSIS is a bone disease that develops when bone mineral density and bone mass decreases, or when the quality or structure of bone changes.
This model was created using the dataset provided by the company .
This disease can develop after a certain age in women or Medical History of a person could be the reason of develeoping osteoporosis .
Such various contraints are considered while developing and training of the model.
Such constraints are responsible for determining if a person is osteoporotic or not .
This Machine Learning model was integerated on a website created using Streamlist for its deployment and the Internship was succefully completed .
